# sports-new-tab-react

This is a re-write of [my sports new tab chrome extension](https://github.com/OneiricArts/CustomizeNewTab).

Only some of the work is being done in this repo. The rest of it is in [ the original CustomizeNewTab repo](https://github.com/OneiricArts/CustomizeNewTab), where I have written new code to be usable by both repos as well as refactor old code to be reusable and reduce dependencies.


It also gives me a playground to try new React and TypeScript features.

**The goal** of this repo is to quickly create an MVP that carries over core functionality _and_ showcase functionality not possible in the original extension.
